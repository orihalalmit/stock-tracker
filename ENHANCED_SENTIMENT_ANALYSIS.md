## 📊 Sentiment Score Calculation

The enhanced sentiment score (0-100) is calculated using a weighted average of five components:

```javascript
Score = (Performance × 0.30) + (Volatility × 0.20) + (Market Alignment × 0.25) + (Trend × 0.15) + (Diversification × 0.10)
```

### Score Interpretation:
- **80-100**: Very Bullish
- **65-79**: Bullish  
- **55-64**: Moderately Bullish
- **45-54**: Neutral
- **35-44**: Moderately Bearish
- **20-34**: Bearish
- **0-19**: Very Bearish

## 🎯 Confidence Scoring

The system calculates confidence levels (0.3-1.0) based on:
- Portfolio size (more positions = higher confidence)
- Data quality and consistency
- Market volatility levels
- Trend consistency across timeframes

## 🌍 Market Alignment Features

### Benchmark Tracking
- **SPY**: S&P 500 ETF for large-cap market sentiment
- **QQQ**: NASDAQ 100 ETF for tech-heavy market sentiment  
- **VXX**: Volatility ETF as VIX proxy for fear/greed measurement
- **IWM**: Russell 2000 ETF for small-cap market sentiment

### Alignment Categories
- **Strongly Correlated**: Portfolio moves with market (correlation > 0.7)
- **Moderately Correlated**: Some market alignment (correlation 0.3-0.7)
- **Neutral**: Independent movement (correlation -0.3 to 0.3)
- **Moderately Contrarian**: Against market trends (correlation -0.7 to -0.3)
- **Strongly Contrarian**: Opposite market movement (correlation < -0.7)

## Understanding the Sharpe Ratio

The **Sharpe Ratio** is a key risk-adjusted performance metric that measures how much excess return you receive for the extra volatility you endure for holding a riskier asset.

### Formula
```
Sharpe Ratio = (Portfolio Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Portfolio Volatility
```

### Interpretation
- **> 1.0**: Excellent risk-adjusted returns
- **0.5 - 1.0**: Good risk-adjusted returns  
- **0.0 - 0.5**: Poor risk-adjusted returns
- **< 0.0**: Losing money relative to risk-free investments

### Why It Might Show 0.00

The Sharpe Ratio will display as 0.00 when:

1. **No Historical Data**: Newly added positions without sufficient trading history
2. **API Unavailable**: Market data service is temporarily unavailable
3. **Zero Volatility**: Portfolio has no price movement (extremely rare)
4. **Insufficient Data Points**: Less than 5 days of historical returns

### Implementation Details

Our enhanced system now:
- Fetches 30 days of historical price data for all portfolio positions
- Calculates daily portfolio returns weighted by position size
- Computes the Sharpe ratio using actual historical performance
- Displays the number of data points used in the calculation
- Shows a warning when insufficient data is available

The system will automatically improve the Sharpe ratio accuracy as more historical data becomes available.
